- I am building my learning process around [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and it's community, though I am using various resources.

- At the same time, I am working on bunch of small learning projects and code challenges in order to develop problem solving skills and learn more about various dev tools.

- Also, I am helping learners on [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) with their issues, if and when my skills and knowledge allow me to answer their questions properly.
